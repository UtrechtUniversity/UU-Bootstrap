# UU-Bootstrap

A custom build/extension of Bootstrap 5 for websites and web-apps developed at/for Utrecht
University.

Our aim is to provide a high quality (reference) implementation of the
[UU Corporate Identity](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/corporate-identity).

## Usage

Either include `scss/bootstrap.scss` in your SCSS or use one of the compiled CSS files from
'releases'.

Compiled CSS files also contains all the Bootstrap 5 CSS, but you'll need to source your own copy of
the Bootstrap 5 JavaScript.

For further implementation details, see the docs!

## Maintainers & contributing

## FAQ

### I'm working for Utrecht University, can I use this project for my own work?

Yes!

### I'm a student at/not affiliated with the UU, can I use this project for my own work?

Yes! However, please keep in mind that the license only grants limited use of UU trademarks etc.
Thus, we recommend using the lite build of the project, as that version only includes the generic
additions to bootstrap.

Please reach out to us if you are unsure/have any questions.
