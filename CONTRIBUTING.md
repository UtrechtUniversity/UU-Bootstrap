## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available
> [Documentation](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/UU-Bootstrap/).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](/issues) or
[Discussions](/discussions) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue/discussion
and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to
search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the
following:

-   Open a [Discussion](/discussions/new/choose) or an [Issue](/issues/new).
    -   An issue is preferred if you think something is not behaving as it should be
    -   A discussion is preferred if you have a different question
-   Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.

We will then take care of your question as soon as possible.

## I Want To Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we
ask you to describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in
advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

-   Make sure that you are using the latest version.
-   Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side (Make sure that you have
    read the [documentation](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/UU-Bootstrap/). If you are looking
    for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
-   To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are
    having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the
    [bug tracker](issues?q=label%3Abug).
-   Collect information about the bug:
    -   Screenshots, if applicable
    -   If you are compiling the project yourself:
        -   Sass output
        -   OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc)
        -   Version of the compiler, runtime environment, package manager, etc
    -   Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?
        -   Providing a minimal example that shows the bug is highly encouraged

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

-   Open an [Issue](/issues/new). (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not,
    we ask you not to label the issue yourself.)
-   Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
-   Please provide as much context as possible and describe the _reproduction steps_ that someone
    else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code.
-   Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

-   The project team will label the issue accordingly.
-   A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no
    reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those
    steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed
    until they are reproduced.
-   If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `bug`, as well as possibly other
    tags (such as `critical`), and the issue will be left to be implemented by someone.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, **including completely new
features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help
maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

-   Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a
    strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind
    that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small
    subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on library.
    -   Support for external libraries/frameworks (such as SuggestJS, DataTables, etc.) will not be
        added to this project itself. We are working on a separate project for those.
    -   In addition, component suggestions that can be easily implemented using a few bootstrap
        utilities/existing components (for example, a sitemap list) are not likely to be added.
-   Make sure that you are using the latest version.
-   Read the [documentation](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/UU-Bootstrap/) carefully and find
    out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
-   Perform a [search](/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add
    a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](/issues).

-   Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
-   Provide a **detailed description of the suggested enhancement**.
-   In case of enhancing an existing component, **describe the current behavior** and **explain
    which behavior you want to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which
    alternatives do not work for you.
-   You may want to **include screenshots and/or animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the
    steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to.
-   **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most users. You may also want to point out
    the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.

### Your First Code Contribution

If you are unfamiliar with working with Git and/or GitHub (or contributing to a project), you can
check out [this guide](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions).

Please also take a look at the style section of this document to see how you should name your
branches/commits.

## Project team

The project team consists of a small group of maintainers and a larger group of developers. Both
work directly on the project, but the maintainers are also responsible for (peer) code reviews of
pull requests, triaging issues and handling releases.

### Maintainers

This project is currently maintained by the Portal Development team of
[Humanities IT](https://cdh.uu.nl/research/humanities-it/), part of the
[Centre For Digital Humanities](https://cdh.uu.nl).

We are willing and looking for other teams of Utrecht University to share maintainer
responsibilities with. If your team is interested, please do contact us!

### Developers

To avoid creating a large group of people with maintainer access, we limit the number of maintainers
to (around) 2 per team. Other team members can get developer access instead.

This only gives write access to the project repository (aside from the protected branches).

If your team does not want maintainership, but does want to contribute regularly, developer access
can also be given in that case.

## Style guides

### Code style

The project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to format both the SCSS files and the documentation
source files. You can run Prettier manually by running the `yarn format` command in your favourite
shell.

Your editor probably also supports running Prettier automatically, please see Prettier's
[Editor Integration](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors) page for more information.

When you open a Pull Request, a CI workflow will check if any files are not properly formatted, so
please remember to format your code before committing!

### Commit Messages

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for
formatting commit messages. This leads to a more readable history at a glance, and makes writing
changelogs easier.

As always, try to make your description as descriptive as possible, optionally using a body for more
details.

#### Format

A commit message must contain a header, and may contain a body and footer. The header must include a
`type` and a `description` and may contain a `scope`:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

<body>

<footer>
```

No line in the commit message may be longer than 100 characters.

#### Types

The following `types` are used in the project:

-   `fix`: A bugfix
-   `feat`: A new feature
-   `docs`: Changes to the documentation only. Changes to the documentation for a new feature may be
    committed alongside the code changes. In that case, `feat` takes priority over `docs`
-   `refactor`: For refactors
-   `ci`: Changes to a GitHub actions workflow
-   `deps`: Updates to a dependency, not related to a single `feat` or `fix`
-   `chore`: Other changes that don't modify source files or the docs.

#### Scopes

The scope should be the name of the affected component (for example: `tiles`, `button`, `stepper`).
There is one exception: all UU-Layout components use the same scope: `uu-layout`.

#### Description

The description should be a short line describing the change.

#### Body

The body may be used to further explain the change and/or provide motivation for the change.

#### Footer

The footer should be used to reference GitHub issues the commit addresses. (For example:
`Closes #42`).

It may also be used for adding
[co-authoring information](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors).
For example: `Co-authored-by: Jane Doe <JANE.DOE@EXAMPLE.COM>`
