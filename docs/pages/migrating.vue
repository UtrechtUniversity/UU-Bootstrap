                    This Bootstrap 5 version is a re-implementation of the old theme, thus isn't
                    backwards compatible. In particular, the base layout has been completely
                    re-imagined. However, as every project uses the same Django base template,
                    you'll only need to update project to CDH core 3+. This has the new layout
                    already implemented in it's new base-template.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are however, more caveats; firstly, Bootstrap 5 has it's own breaking
                    changes, see their
                    <NuxtLink to="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/migration/" target="_blank">
                        documentation.
                    </NuxtLink>
                    Really. Do read them for a bit, just scroll through anything marked 'breaking'
                    if you don't want to read all of it.
                </p>
                <h3 class="hdr-underlined">Containers</h3>
                <p>
                    The <code>.uu-inner-container</code> class is now deprecated. Please use the
                    new, equivalent, <code>.uu-container</code> or <code>.uu-row</code> classes. The
                    old class is still provided as a fallback, but it's a hack and is going to be
                    removed at some point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The new classes now come with vertical padding, so any
                    <code>.mt-{x} .mb-{x}</code> classes <i>probably</i> aren't needed anymore. Feel
                    free to use them anyway if you want tho.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, while previously you could 'cheat' and take the full 1600px of the outer
                    container by simply omitting a
                    <code>.uu-inner-container</code>, this was never supported nor intended and now
                    looks fugly (or might break your page entirely). Instead, use the new
                    <code>.uu-fullwidth-container</code> that was newly created for this purpose.
                </p>
                <h3 class="hdr-underlined">Buttons</h3>
                <p>
                    The previously completely custom <code>.button</code> based classes have not
                    been ported. Instead, use Bootstrap buttons (<code>.btn</code> based).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Buttons don't get a background color by default anymore, so remember to set a
                    <i>button variant class</i> on your existing buttons. The two you'll probably
                    need are <code>.btn-primary</code> (UU yellow) and
                    <code>.btn-secondary</code> (black).
                </p>
                <p>Also, the paddings are a bit different, keep that in mind.</p>
                <h3 class="hdr-underlined">Visibility helpers</h3>
                <p>
                    <code>.show-xs</code> and <code>.hide-xs</code> were not ported. Please use the
